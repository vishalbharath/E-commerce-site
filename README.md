## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed for version control.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vishalbharath/E-commerce-site.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd e-commerce--shopper
    ```

### Setting Up the Front-End

1. Create the React app for the frontend:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app frontend
    ```

2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Setting Up the Admin Panel

1. Create the React app for the admin panel:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app admin
    ```

2. Navigate to the `admin` directory and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ../admin
    npm install
    ```

### Setting Up the Back-End

1. Create the `back-end` directory and initialize it:

    ```bash
    mkdir back-end
    cd back-end
    npm init -y
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (Express, for example):

    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```

3. Create an `app.js` file (or `index.js`) and set up a basic Express server:

    ```javascript
    // app.js
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const port = 5000;

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello, world!');
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
    ```

## Running the Project

### Running the Front-End

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Start the React development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. The front-end should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running the Admin Panel

1. Navigate to the `admin` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../admin
    ```

2. Start the React development server:
